# STM32_Pill_Boards

This repo contains my abandoned attemps to create a STM32F4 based board on the BluePill form factor, 
as well as a copy of the STM32STAMP board - renamed to F405Pill (this board is not the same form factor as the Blue Pill)

For various reasons, its not practical or economic to create such a board, with the main problem being the extremely small width of the Blue Pill
0.6 inch between the rows of pins.

Although the F411 (64 pin version), would fit in such a small form factor, its only has a clock speed of 100Mhz and the drawback of only having one ADC.

So the 5 or 6 fold price difference between the F103C8 Blue Pill and a F411 based board, would make it a very niche product and not worth wasting time on.

Hence I'm abandoning this idea, and just posting the files in case they are beneficial to anyone else
